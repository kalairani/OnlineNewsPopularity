# OnlineNewsPopularity - Mashable.com
Personal project to analyse the historical data of articles for an digital entertainment company and using those parameters to predict number of shares for an article.

Code and data are available under package mashable.articles. 
Below are the steps to run the files, in windows:
  - Download and extract the repository OnlineNewsPopularity(ex: c:/temp)
  - Open Command prompt
  - Set the path to repository (location of mashable directory, ex: c:/temp/OnlineNewsPopularity)
  - Launch the below command
  ```
     <PY_HOME>/python -m mashable.articles.predictModel
  ```  
Concluded that Random Forest Classifier Model is better fit for the prediction.

*NOTE:* Python should be installed the required packages as pandas, sklearn, numpy etc

Thank you!
